# People Analytics

Analysed data of survey conducted by PLASTARC - across five organisations, accounting for employee preferences and productivity in a post-COVID world.
<br>
The data was composed of 1000+ responses, across 185 variables that were presented to the employees of 5 organizations that work across different sectors - Manufacturing, Information Services, Construction Management, Finance and Accounting. <br>
Customized work strategy eg. Organisation 5 has 528 students - ~65% employees prefer working from home after pandemic, ~35% employees feel that coming into the office increases their productivity and wellbeing. Instead of 3-4 days a week, it is recommended to have 2 days of collaboration from the office, while 3 days working from home. If the organisation infrastructurally prefers 3 days working from the office, the recommendation would be to design the workspace such that the desks allow privacy of the employees.
